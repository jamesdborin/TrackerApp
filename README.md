Workout Tracker App

Description:
-----
This is an app designed for simple and quick storage, access, and visualisation
of data generated as part of a workout routine.

This is differentiated from most apps by a unique relational graph which defines
a hierarchy of exercises from specific movements/speeds/strengh curves to large
movement patterns. This allows the user to see volume accumulated over multiple 
hierarchy levels. This is meant to accommodate the issue with usual tracking 
software which penalises variety in exercsie choice as either: 

a) switching between exercises causes gaps in work even if you are doing 
closely related exercises
